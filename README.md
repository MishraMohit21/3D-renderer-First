## Introduction
This project aims to create a basic 3D rendering engine from scratch. The engine will render 3D objects using simple algorithms and techniques. It is an educational project intended to help you understand the fundamentals of 3D graphics programming.

## Features
- Render basic 3D shapes
- Simple shading
- Camera control
- Basic transformations (translation, rotation, scaling)

## Installation
To get started with this project, you need to have the following tools installed on your system:
- A C++ compiler (GCC, Clang, MSVC, etc.)
- CMake (a build system generator)

### Steps to Install
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/MishraMohit21/3D-renderer-First.git
    cd 3D-renderer-First
    ```
2. Create a build directory:
    ```bash
    mkdir build
    cd build
    ```
3. Generate the build files using CMake:
    ```bash
    cmake ..
    ```
4. Build the project:
    ```bash
    make
    ```

## Usage
After successfully building the project, you can run the executable to see the 3D renderer in action.

### Running the Renderer
1. Navigate to the build directory:
    ```bash
    cd build
    ```
2. Run the executable:
    ```bash
    ./3DRenderer
    ```

You should see a window displaying the rendered 3D objects.
